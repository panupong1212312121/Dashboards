### **üí° Key Insights**

* **Dual Election View:** The dashboard is divided into two main sections, providing separate but detailed insights for both the **Bangkok Governor (‡∏ú‡∏π‡πâ‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤‡∏Ø ‡∏Å‡∏ó‡∏°.)** and **City Council (‡∏™.‡∏Å.)** elections.
* **Voter Behavior:** The dashboard highlights key voter behaviors, including turnout rates, the number of invalid ballots, and the percentage of "no-vote" selections. This allows for a deeper understanding of voter engagement and preferences across different districts.
* **Performance Comparison:** Users can compare the performance of candidates by analyzing their total votes and vote share. The visuals reveal how votes were distributed among candidates in each election, providing a clear picture of the electoral landscape.
