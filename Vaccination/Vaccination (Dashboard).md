### **üìä Project Goals & Key Metrics**

* **Objective:** To analyze vaccination service data to understand demographic patterns, vaccine preferences, and operational trends.
* **Key Metrics:**
    * **Patient Demographics:** Distribution of vaccine recipients by location (Bangkok vs. Non-Bangkok), age, and gender.
    * **Vaccine Type:** The proportion of each vaccine type administered.
    * **Service Location Analysis:** Vaccination volume by service location and day of the week.

### **üí° Key Insights**

* **Demographic Patterns:** The majority of vaccine recipients are residents of Bangkok, with an even split between male and female patients. The most common age group receiving vaccinations are seniors (60+ years old), followed by the middle-aged population (40-59 years old), indicating a strong uptake among these priority groups.
* **Vaccine Preference Disparity:** While overall vaccination type distribution is similar between Bangkok and non-Bangkok residents, there are notable differences when analyzed by age. A key finding is that the **Moxer** vaccine, which is often considered a high-quality option, is significantly less allocated to non-Bangkok residents (with a 24% difference in distribution).
* **Cross-Province Travel:** The data suggests that non-Bangkok residents are traveling to Bangkok to receive the Moxer vaccine. This is evidenced by the fact that over 40% of Moxer vaccine recipients at Bangkok-based clinics are from other provinces, likely due to limited access to this specific vaccine in their local areas.
* **Service Scheduling:** The dashboard highlights a clear pattern in service demand. Vaccination centers experience lower traffic on Wednesdays and Fridays compared to other weekdays. In Bangkok, Central Station is a key vaccination hub, receiving a large volume of daily visitors.
