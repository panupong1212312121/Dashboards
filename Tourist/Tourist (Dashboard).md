### **üí° Key Insights**

* **Significant Visitor Peak:** The dashboard shows a peak of approximately 676,000 visitors, highlighting a major event or popular period that drew a massive crowd to a single location.
* **Impact of COVID-19:** A dramatic decline in tourist numbers is evident from 2019 onwards, reaching a low point in 2021. This trend directly correlates with the global COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions. Visitor numbers show a clear recovery in 2022 as lockdowns were lifted.
* **High Season Peaks:** Visitation is highest during December and January, driven by year-end holidays, Christmas, and New Year celebrations. The data also shows a significant peak in April, which aligns with the Songkran festival, a major public holiday in Thailand.
* **Low Season Trends:** Tourist numbers drop significantly during the May to September period. This decline is typically due to the monsoon or rainy season, which affects travel plans and outdoor activities in many of the country's natural parks.
